## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for Team 5's Virtual Processor Project. The project's main goal is to create a virtual processor capable of executing assembly code. Developed in C, the processor adheres to principles of portability and efficiency.

The virtual processor serves as a simplified platform for understanding and executing basic assembly instructions. It's primarily an educational tool, designed to facilitate the learning of low-level programming concepts. The processor is equipped to handle a custom assembly language, the details of which are fully outlined in the project's functional specification.

This project emphasizes the importance of efficient programming practices and the intricacies of processor design and operation. The functional specification document serves as a guideline for developers and contributors, ensuring that all aspects of the project align with the outlined objectives and standards.

For more details, please refer to the functionalSpecification.md file [here](/Specifications/functionalSpecification.md).


## To Launch

to launch the program you must first have GCC to compile

for the installation for a windows system here is the link [https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcc-win64/]

for the installation for a MacOs system here is the link [https://brew.sh]

after installing GCC copy the repository either by installing it in zip or by copying the link

if you decide to copy the link, go to your desktop, right click, open in the terminal and mark (git clone [then insert the link])

otherwise just uncompress the install folder

after doing all that open the folder in an IDE (Visual Studio Code is recommended here)

arrive at the code you must change some path before launching the program in the files (main.c and utils.h) the locations will be indicated by these messages

 //! change the the left file path to the directory of the file by your own

to change the path you must right click on (code.txt) press (copy path) and then do a control v or right click and press paste

then add a second slash to all the places where there is only one

after doing this you can
go to the main.c file and then
press the top right arrow and select gcc gnu
Once the file is fully compiled, press the arrow at the top right a second time.
