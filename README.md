# Project Description

This repository contains the source code for Team 5's Virtual Processor Project. The project's main goal is to create a virtual processor capable of executing assembly code. Developed in C, the processor adheres to principles of portability and efficiency.

The virtual processor serves as a simplified platform for understanding and executing basic assembly instructions. It's primarily an educational tool, designed to facilitate the learning of low-level programming concepts. The processor is equipped to handle a custom assembly language, the details of which are fully outlined in the project's functional specification.

This project emphasizes the importance of efficient programming practices and the intricacies of processor design and operation. The functional specification document serves as a guideline for developers and contributors, ensuring that all aspects of the project align with the outlined objectives and standards.

For more details, please refer to the functionalSpecification.md file [here](/Specifications/functionalSpecification.md).
