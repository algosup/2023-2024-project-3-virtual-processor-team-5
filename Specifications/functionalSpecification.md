## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive functional specification for Team 5's Virtual Processor Project. This project involves the creation of a virtual processor designed to execute assembly code. The processor is to be developed in the C programming language, adhering to principles of portability and efficiency. This document outlines the essential elements and specifications of the project, including the development environment, assembly language design, and implementation details.

The virtual processor aims to offer a simplified yet functional platform for understanding and executing basic assembly instructions. It serves as an educational tool, facilitating the learning of low-level programming concepts. The processor will be equipped to handle a custom assembly language, which will be fully detailed in this specification. The project will emphasize the importance of efficient programming practices and the intricacies of processor design and operation.

This specification serves as a guideline for developers and contributors to understand the project's goals, requirements, and design philosophy. It will ensure that all aspects of the project align with the outlined objectives and standards.
