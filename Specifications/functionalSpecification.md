## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive functional specification for Team 5's Virtual Processor Project. This project involves the creation of a virtual processor designed to execute assembly code. The processor is to be developed in the C programming language, adhering to principles of portability and efficiency. This document outlines the essential elements and specifications of the project, including the development environment, assembly language design, and implementation details.

The virtual processor aims to offer a simplified yet functional platform for understanding and executing basic assembly instructions. It serves as an educational tool, facilitating the learning of low-level programming concepts. The processor will be equipped to handle a custom assembly language, which will be fully detailed in this specification. The project will emphasize the importance of efficient programming practices and the intricacies of processor design and operation.

This specification serves as a guideline for developers and contributors to understand the project's goals, requirements, and design philosophy. It will ensure that all aspects of the project align with the outlined objectives and standards.

## 2. Development Environment

The development of the Virtual Processor will be conducted in a specific programming and toolset environment to ensure consistency, compatibility, and performance. The key components of this environment are:

- **Programming Language**: The entire project is to be developed in standard C language. This choice is made to leverage the portability and efficiency of C, making the virtual processor adaptable to various platforms.

- **Compiler**: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is designated as the primary compiler. Its widespread availability and compatibility with various operating systems make it an ideal choice.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended for its versatility and robust support for C/C++ development. It offers valuable features like debugging tools and source code management integration.

- **Libraries**: Only standard C libraries are to be used in this project. The use of external or third-party libraries is restricted to ensure the simplicity and portability of the code.

- **Version Control**: Git, in conjunction with GitHub, will be used for source code management. This allows for effective collaboration, version tracking, and code review processes.

- **Code Style and Conventions**: Adherence to common C programming conventions is expected to maintain code readability and maintainability. A specific style guide will be provided to ensure consistency across the project.

This environment is chosen to balance functionality, ease of use, and accessibility for developers. It will support the project's goals of creating a portable and efficient virtual processor.
