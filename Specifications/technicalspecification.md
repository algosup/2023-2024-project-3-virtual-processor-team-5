# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Customer Request
We are asked in the call of tender to create a virtual processor and an interpreter to run assembly code on this processor. This project must be carried out in the basic C code language, that is to say without the use of any external library apart from the standard C libraries. This project's recommendations are to use gcc as compiler and Visual Studio Code as IDE.

First, we need to invent a minimal assembly language for our processor. Our set of instructions must contain at least the following instructions:
• Storing an immediate value in a register.
• Copying the value of one register into another register.
• Read the value from memory at the address contained by a register and store it in
another register.
• Storing the value of a register in memory at the address contained by another register.
• Compare the contents of the registers.
• Unconditionally move to a label.
• Jump conditionally to a label.
• Calling a subroutine.
• Return from a subroutine.
• The 4 basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
• The 4 basic logical operations: OR, AND, XOR and NOT.

then we need to write a C program capable of reading a text file containing a program written in our
assembly dialect and run it. The C program must also verify that the assembly program is
semantically valid and detect syntactic errors.In order to see that the assembly program is actually running, we also need to implement a virtual system call to
display text in a virtual terminal, accessible from assembly code. we also need to display
the contents of the registers and have a built-in debugger.
And finally we need to be able to write small assembly programs conceptually similar to unit tests to prove that everything works as expected.

## 1.2 Document Purpose & Definition

The goal of the Technical Specifications is to take the Functional Requirements which defines the features, scope and goals of the project, to dissect each requirement and turn it into instructions, as clear as possible, to guide the development team as well as the quality assurance team in the successful completion of their mission.

We therefore encourage thorough reading of the [Functional Specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-5/blob/main/Specifications/functionalSpecification.md) before further reading.

The goal of the Technical Requirements is to clarify as many dark areas as possible to avoid the engineers making decisions
In a sense, while the Functional Requirements represent the "What/Why" aspect of the project, the Technical Requirements are supposed to represent the "How" of the project.

With that being said, we will try to cover as many functional and non-functional aspects of the project while making technological and architectural decisions, evaluating those decisions, measuring their associated risks and impact (providing mitigation) and compare those to other potential solutions.

The document should also benefit other stakeholders and project owners by giving insight into our methodology and may serve as a future reference for maintenance or simple documentation purposes.

The C language is still widely used in software development, and many critical systems and applications depend on it. 

## 1.4 Project Overview

### 1.4.1 Project Brief
As stated in the Functional Requirements,this project involves the creation of a virtual processor designed to execute assembly code.

we have been given 7 week to complete this project
Looking deeper into the project we decided to have a meeting together to find out what to start, to agree on the direction to take and also to know what we wanted as a result at the end of the project.
After this meeting we decided to adopt a step-by-step strategy with daily tasks. We find that this method is simpler to follow and is the simplest to be effective.

### 1.4.2 Requirements
Even if this document is intended to be as exhaustive and demonstrative as possible, it is expected that its reader has some basic knowledge in virtual machines, more precisely in this case in virtual processors, and also certain knowledge in programming.

As indicated in the call for tender, at the end of the project we must be able to code in an assembler created by us with an interpreter also created by us, execute it on a virtual processor also created by us, be able to prove that it executes well by making a virtual terminal and finally we can also display
the contents of the registers and have a built-in debugger.

the task may seem difficult, it is true that it is not the simplest project but with good organization and respect for the tasks the project can greatly improve the ease of progress of this project.

As an IDE visual studio code allows us to run all our programs in a simple and portable way, which means that PC and Mac team members will be able to run and test the program, which will prove useful during the process of development.

#### Setting up the Development Environment

The first step is to set up the development environment, which we can define as follows:
##### Software Requirements
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE to run our code simply and efficiently
- the programming language is [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#:~:text=C%20is%20an%20imperative%20procedural,all%20with%20minimal%20runtime) to program our entire project
- pour compiler notre en c nous utilisons le compiler [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)
- we use Github or other source control management to  communicate the progress of our project, [Github](https://github.com/) is recommended for this task.
- we also use [trello](https://trello.com/) for our step-by-step strategy by putting the different tasks to do during the day for better optimization of time.

#### Coding Methodology

##### How We'll Go About It

1. ######  **Requirements Analysis:**
  - We begin by thoroughly understanding what the clients want, detailing all the requirements.

2. ###### **Quick Daily Meetings:**
  - Every day, we gather quickly to discuss progress, potential issues, and plan tasks for the day.
  - We keep our Trello board updated for effective organization.

3. ######  **Version Control with Git:**
  - We use Git and GitHub to keep track of all versions of our code.
  - Whenever we add something new or fix a bug, we create a specific branch.

4. ######  **Modular Development:**
  - The project is broken down into logical pieces, each serving a specific purpose.
  - We use header files to clearly define what each piece does.
  - For each piece, we write tests to ensure it functions correctly.

5. ######  **Continuous Integration:**
  - Whenever we make a change, we ensure the entire project compiles correctly and passes all tests.

6. ######  **Testing:**
  - We avoid unpleasant surprises by writing tests for everything. Small tests for each piece and comprehensive tests for the entire system.
  - This prevents tears later on.

7. ######  **Documentation:**
  - No need to guess what each piece does. We document everything.
  - Clear comments in the code and a detailed README for everyone to understand.

8. ######  **Debugging:**
  - We're not all perfect, so we use debugging tools to track down and eliminate bugs.
  - Serious testing and debugging during development.

9. ######  **Code Reviews:**
  - We trust each other, but two pairs of eyes are better than one. We review the code of others and provide constructive feedback.

##### Workflow
The development team began working on features requested in the project's call for tender, such as storing an immediate value in a register.
• Copy the value of one register to another register.
• Read the value in memory at the address contained by a register and store it in
another register.
• Storing the value of a register in memory at the address contained by another register.
• Compare the contents of the registers.
• Unconditionally move to a label.
• Jump conditionally to a label.
• Calling a subroutine.
• Return from a subroutine.
• The 4 basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
• The 4 basic logical operations: OR, AND, XOR and NOT.
before the specifications are fully understood and defined.

Once the functional specifications are dissected into the technical specifications, the project functions and features are all reflected in the trello in the form of “Tasks” which we prefer to call “tickets” internally.
Each of these tickets is then sent to QA in the "next release" section once verified, the tickets are sent to the "done" section, assigned to the team members and prioritized by the project manager or technical manager, in function of the task.

Each ticket represents a part of the work, a bug found, a feature request, an update. This abstraction makes it possible to track many types of tasks, break them down even further, and move forward quickly.
We will return to this more at the end of this document.
##### Coding Conventions
###### Naming
- We use camelCase notation for our variables and functions.
- Constants are in uppercase with underscores.
###### Formatting
- We indent with 4 spaces to ensure consistent readability.
- Opening braces are placed on the same line as the control statements.
###### Comments
- We use meaningful comments to clarify the code.
- Comment near 100% of the Functions in the code.

##### Documenting Conventions

We will automatically generate documentation for this project.
How to use it will also be included in the readme.

##### Test Procedure

we will test all the functionalities of the project little by little during the project for better efficiency instead of testing everything on the same day to avoid an unpleasant surprise on the day of the final rendering.

#### Setting up the Virtual Processor
##### Software Requirements
For the virtual processor development, we need the following software tools and components:

- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): We will use VSCode as the IDE for writing, editing, and managing our C code. It provides a simple and efficient platform for development.

- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#:~:text=C%20is%20an%20imperative%20procedural,all%20with%20minimal%20runtime): The entire project will be implemented in the C language. It is a powerful and efficient language, suitable for system-level development.

- [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org): We will use GCC as the C compiler for our project.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): We will utilize GitHub for source code management, version control, and collaboration among team members.

- [Trello](https://trello.com/): Trello will be our project management tool for organizing tasks, setting priorities, and tracking progress with a step-by-step strategy.

#### Coding Methodology

##### Testing Framework:

Unit Testing Framework (e.g., Unity or CUnit): To ensure the correctness of our code, we will implement unit tests for individual components and system functionalities. The choice of a specific testing framework will be determined during the project.

##### Debugger:

Debugger in Visual Studio Code: We will leverage the debugging features provided by VSCode to identify, analyze, and correct errors in our code. This includes setting breakpoints, inspecting variable values, and stepping through code execution.

##### Continuous Integration:

Continuous Integration Tool (e.g., Jenkins or Travis CI): To maintain code quality, we will implement continuous integration, ensuring that the entire project compiles correctly and passes all tests with each code change.

##### Virtual Terminal Implementation:

A mechanism to simulate a virtual terminal for displaying text output from assembly code. This will be implemented as part of the virtual processor, and the details will be defined during the development process.

##### Built-in Debugger Implementation:

A built-in debugger for the virtual processor, integrated into the development environment. This debugger will assist in identifying and resolving issues during the execution of assembly code.
